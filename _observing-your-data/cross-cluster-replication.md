# Cross-cluster search

With cross-cluster search, you can query and visualize data stored in multiple MCdesk clusters using the Logs feature in Observability. This works across domain boundaries, so you can query data from any index, in any MCdesk cluster, from a single interface and perform the same operations against the data as if it came from a single source.

For detailed documentation, including configuration, usage, and authentication, see [Cross-cluster search](https://github.com/igsl-group/sql/blob/main/docs/user/ppl/admin/cross_cluster_search.rst).
