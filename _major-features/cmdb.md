**The Single Source of Truth for IT Assets**

## Major Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Discovery Tools** | Automated discovery of Configuration Items (CIs) like hardware, software, and services. Automated or manual methods to discover and populate information about IT assets (Configuration Items - CIs). |
| **CI Relationship Mapping** | Ability to define and visualize relationships between CIs (e.g., a server hosts an application, which is accessed by users). |
| **Configuration management and control** | Storing detailed attributes for each CI (e.g., hardware specs, software versions, owner, location). |
| **Reconciliation** | Mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and integrity of CMDB data. |
| **Integration** | APIs to integrate with other ITSM modules and external systems for automated data updates. Integration with other modules (Incident, Problem, Change) for impact analysis. |

## ITIL 4 Process / Practice Alignment

| Practice | Alignment |
|----------|-----------|
| **Service Configuration Management** | The CMDB is the "single source of truth" that this practice relies on. The CMDB is the central component for this process, providing a record of CIs and their relationships. |
| **Incident Management, Problem Management, Change Enablement, Service Level Management** | Foundation for other practices: Critical for accurate impact assessment in Incident, Problem, and Change Enablement. It enables a holistic view of the service landscape. A comprehensive CMDB is essential for these practices. |
| **Service Design** | Provides information about existing components for designing new services. |
