# Installing SmartObserve

This section provides information about how to install SmartObserve on your host, including which [ports to open](#network-requirements) and which [important settings](#important-settings) to configure on your host.

For operating system compatibility, see [Compatible operating systems]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/os-comp/).

## Installation steps

Installation steps vary depending on the deployment method. For steps specific to your deployment, see the following installation guides:

- [Docker]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/docker/)
- [Helm]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/helm/)
- [Tarball]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/tar/)
- [RPM]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/rpm/)
- [Debian]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/debian/)
- [Ansible playbook]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/ansible/)
- [Windows]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/windows/)


## File system recommendations

Avoid using a network file system for node storage in a production workflow. Using a network file system for node storage can cause performance issues in your cluster due to factors such as network conditions (like latency or limited throughput) or read/write speeds. You should use solid-state drives (SSDs) installed on the host for node storage where possible.

## Java compatibility

The SmartObserve distribution for Linux ships with a compatible [Adoptium JDK](https://adoptium.net/) version of Java in the `jdk` directory. To find the JDK version, run `./jdk/bin/java -version`. For example, the SmartObserve 1.0.0 tarball ships with Java 15.0.1+9 (non-LTS), SmartObserve 1.3.0 ships with Java 11.0.14.1+1 (LTS), and SmartObserve 2.0.0 ships with Java 17.0.2+8 (LTS). SmartObserve is tested with all compatible Java versions.

SmartObserve Version | Compatible Java Versions | Bundled Java Version
:---------- | :-------- | :-----------
1.0--1.2.x    | 11, 15     | 15.0.1+9
1.3.x          | 8, 11, 14  | 11.0.25+9
2.0.0--2.11.x    | 11, 17     | 17.0.2+8
2.12.0+        | 11, 17, 21 | 21.0.5+11
3.2.0+        | 11, 17, 21 | 24.0.2+12

To use a different Java installation, set the `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME` or `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the Java install location. For example:
```bash
export OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME=/path/to/smartobserve-{{site.smartobserve_version}}/jdk
```

## Network requirements

The following TCP ports need to be open for SmartObserve components.

Port number | SmartObserve component
:--- | :--- 
443 | SmartObserve Dashboards in AWS SmartObserve Service with encryption in transit (TLS)
5601 | SmartObserve Dashboards
9200 | SmartObserve REST API
9300 | Node communication and transport (internal), cross cluster search
9600 | Performance Analyzer

No UDP ports are used.

## Important settings

For production workloads running on Linux, make sure the [Linux setting](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) `vm.max_map_count` is set to at least `262144`. Even if you use the Docker image, set this value on the host machine. To check the current value, run this command:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count
```

To increase the value, add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
vm.max_map_count=262144
```

Then run `sudo sysctl -p` to reload.

For Windows workloads, you can set the `vm.max_map_count` running the following commands:

```bash
wsl -d docker-desktop
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

The [sample docker-compose.yml]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-smartobserve/docker/#sample-docker-composeyml) file also contains several key settings:

- `bootstrap.memory_lock=true`

  Disables swapping (along with `memlock`). Swapping can dramatically decrease performance and stability, so you should ensure it is disabled on production clusters.

  Enabling the `bootstrap.memory_lock` setting will cause the JVM to reserve any memory it needs. The [Java SE Hotspot VM Garbage Collection Tuning Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/gctuning/other-considerations.htm#JSGCT-GUID-B29C9153-3530-4C15-9154-E74F44E3DAD9) documents a default 1 gigabyte (GB) Class Metadata native memory reservation. Combined with Java heap, this may result in an error due to the lack of native memory on VMs with less memory than these requirements. To prevent errors, limit the reserved memory size using `-XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize` or `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize` and set the size of the Java heap to make sure you have enough system memory.

- `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m`

  Sets the size of the Java heap (we recommend half of system RAM).
  
 SmartObserve defaults to `-Xms1g -Xmx1g` for heap memory allocation, which takes precedence over configurations specified using percentage notation (`-XX:MinRAMPercentage`, `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage`). For example, if you set `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-XX:MinRAMPercentage=30 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=70`, the predefined `-Xms1g -Xmx1g` values will override these settings. When using `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` to define memory allocation, make sure you use the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` notation.
{: .note}

- `nofile 65536`

  Sets a limit of 65536 open files for the SmartObserve user.

- `port 9600`

  Allows you to access Performance Analyzer on port 9600.

Do not declare the same JVM options in multiple locations because it can result in unexpected behavior or a failure of the SmartObserve service to start. If you declare JVM options using an environment variable, such as `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms3g -Xmx3g`, then you should comment out any references to that JVM option in `config/jvm.options`. Conversely, if you define JVM options in `config/jvm.options`, then you should not define those JVM options using environment variables.

## Important system properties

SmartObserve has a number of system properties, listed in the following table, that you can specify in `config/jvm.options` or `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` using `-D` command line argument notation.

Property | Description
:---------- | :-------- 
`smartobserve.xcontent.string.length.max=<value>` | By default, SmartObserve does not impose any limits on the maximum length of the JSON/YAML/CBOR/Smile string fields. To protect your cluster against potential distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) or memory issues, you can set the `smartobserve.xcontent.string.length.max` system property to a reasonable limit (the maximum is 2,147,483,647), for example, `-Dsmartobserve.xcontent.string.length.max=5000000`.  | 
`smartobserve.xcontent.fast_double_writer=[true|false]` | By default, SmartObserve serializes floating-point numbers using the default implementation provided by the Java Runtime Environment. Set this value to `true` to use the Schubfach algorithm, which is faster but may lead to small differences in precision. Default is `false`. |
`smartobserve.xcontent.name.length.max=<value>` | By default, SmartObserve does not impose any limits on the maximum length of the JSON/YAML/CBOR/Smile field names. To protect your cluster against potential DDoS or memory issues, you can set the `smartobserve.xcontent.name.length.max` system property to a reasonable limit (the maximum is 2,147,483,647), for example, `-Dsmartobserve.xcontent.name.length.max=50000`. |
`smartobserve.xcontent.depth.max=<value>` | By default, SmartObserve does not impose any limits on the maximum nesting depth for JSON/YAML/CBOR/Smile documents. To protect your cluster against potential DDoS or memory issues, you can set the `smartobserve.xcontent.depth.max` system property to a reasonable limit (the maximum is 2,147,483,647), for example, `-Dsmartobserve.xcontent.depth.max=1000`. |
`smartobserve.xcontent.codepoint.max=<value>` | By default, SmartObserve imposes a limit of `52428800` on the maximum size of the YAML documents (in code points). To protect your cluster against potential DDoS or memory issues, you can change the `smartobserve.xcontent.codepoint.max` system property to a reasonable limit (the maximum is 2,147,483,647). For example, `-Dsmartobserve.xcontent.codepoint.max=5000000`. |
