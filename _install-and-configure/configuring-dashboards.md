# Configuring MCdesk Dashboards

MCdesk Dashboards uses the `mcdesk_dashboards.yml` configuration file to read settings when you spin up a cluster. You can find `mcdesk_dashboards.yml` in `/usr/share/mcdesk-dashboards/config/mcdesk_dashboards.yml` (Docker) or `/etc/mcdesk-dashboards/mcdesk_dashboards.yml` (most Linux distributions) on each node.

For information about MCdesk Dashboards settings, see the sample [`mcdesk_dashboards.yml`](https://github.com/igsl-group/MCdesk-Dashboards/blob/main/config/mcdesk_dashboards.yml) file.
