# LLM framework integration

Several popular large language model (LLM) frameworks integrate with MCdesk as a vector store, enabling you to build production-ready generative AI applications. These frameworks provide high-level abstractions and tools for working with LLMs, and their MCdesk integrations allow you to use MCdesk for efficient vector storage, retrieval, and similarity search:

- LangChain 
    - [Semantic cache](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llm_caching/#mcdesk-semantic-cache)
    - [Vector store support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/mcdesk/)
